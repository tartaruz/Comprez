# Comprez

All imagenes in the folder originals will get compressed to the folder named compressed

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip3 install tkinder 
```

## Usage
Get to the localization of your git repository and use python to run the code
```python
python3 comprez.py
```

Example:
Compression with a compression rate of 1:
<img src="/files/readme_img/gele.jpg" width="100">
<img src="/files/readme_img/geleOG.jpg" width="100">

A GUI window will popup and ask you for a number between 1-99. This will be the ratio of compression :)
